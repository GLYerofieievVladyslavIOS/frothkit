/*!
	\brief	Subclassable layout class for generating the layout for the request. Like actions, this can be overiden to customize.
				
				However unlike actions, unless this is subclassed and specified in the controller's init[MethodName]Action: method, then the
				defualt site specific layout is used. (An instance of this class)
			
				The defualt implementation always looks for a Template file in the bundle named Layout.[extention]. Controllers can customize
				the Template file name, and to do so, must do it in the - [methodName]Action: method block, allong with the same for changeing
				the Action view's template file.
 
				The default layout view is cached for the life of the application. This provides faster loading as a round-trip to the
				data does not have to occur, only template parsing.
 
				Layout templates are provided with the following values.
				- result The actual string result from the action.
				- controller The controller that called the action
				- req The request object for the action
				- app The main application
				- layout This class.
	
				For an example of the templating syntex see WebActionView background reference.

	\brief	Subclasses can overide this to provide custom data parsing of the templates. 
	\detail	The primary purpose of receiveing the templateData as NSData instead of NSString, as template subclasses
				may return binary data, in which case this layout template could provide an html wrapper for the data and
				return that as a WebResponse. 
				
				Such implementations would be cases where dynamic image data is generated based on the request. This provides
				powerful features for the Froth system.
 
				Subclasses would be responsible for calling -templateStringForController: as this is called from this classes
				implemention.
