/*!
	\brief	Action controller protocal, typically you should use a subclass of WebActiveController as support for implementing
			action controllers that do not inherit from WebActiveController is no longer supported.
			
			<h3>Memory Management</h3>
			Action controllers are the heart of a Cocoa Web App, they are considered short lived
			objects and must implement proper memory management to clean up after themselves. They 
			only live for the lifespan of the request.
			
			<h3>Nominclature of Subclasses</h3>
			Class names must have the format WA<ControllerName>Controller, where the request uri would be 
			controller_name or controllerName. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<i>Example</i><br>
			http://example.com/path/to/webapp/my_blog/some_great_blog <br>
			would get mapped to WAMyBlogController's -(id)someGreatBlog:(WARequest*)req method if implemented and according to
			action routing rules as explained below
			
			<br>
			<i>Future work will be done to free subclasses from the strict nameing conventions</i>
		
			<h3>Request Routing</h3>
			A) {{method-name}} automatically maps to - (id)<methodName>Action:(WebRequest*)wr; if implemented or <br>
			A.1) -(id)object:(WebRequest*)wr if implemented or <br>
			A.2) -(id)defualt:(WebRequest*)wr if implemented <br>
			<br><br>
			<i>CRUD Routing</i>
			B) No Action Method	(GET)				 maps to -(id)index:(WebRequest*)wr; <br>
								(GET)/{v}			 maps to -(id)object:(WebRequest*)wr; <br>
			C) No Action Method (POST/POST)			 maps to -(id)create:(WebRequest*)wr; /-update:... <br>
			E) No Action Method (DELETE)			 maps to -(id)delete:(WebRequest*)wr; <br>

			<br><br>
			The flow of events for a WebRequest object is as such. <br>
			1. WebApplicationController receives a WebRequest. <br>
			2. if controller provides "components" array, call, -preProcessRequest: forController: on each continuing if result is not nil. <br>
			2. WebApplicationController calls - (void)preProcessRequest:(WebRequest*)request if implemented. <br>
			3. WebApplicationController calls - (SEL)selectorForActionName:(NSString*)name if implemented, and uses it as <ActionName> <br>
			4. WebApplicationController insures that <ActionName> is implemented. <br>
			5. WebApplicationController calls - (void)init<ActionName>Action:(WebRequest*)request if implemented <br>
				<br><br>
				<i>The WebApplicationController, should initialize and setup the controller's views, and other properties
				here if a custom (not defualt view) is to be used. Initializeing this method will cause the WebApplicationController
				to not prepare any defualts based on the request.</i>
				<br><br>
			6. Else a class with name <ActionName><ControllerName>View is looked up and initialized if found. <br>
			7. WebApplicationController calls - (id)<actionName>Action:(WebRequest*)request <br>
			8. If the above call returns a WebResponse object, then it is rendered, else... <br>
			9. A WebResponse is returned from [controller.view displayWithData:(above response)] //typically a NSDictionary <br>
			10. WebApplication calls - (void)postProcessResponse:(FOWResponse*)response fromRequest:(WebRequest*)request on controller if implemented <br>
			11. if controller provides "components" array, call -postPRocessResponse for each while result is true (false returns a notFound response) <br>
			
 //TODO: fix documentation for WebLayoutViews

				1. WebViews handleing rendering in the following flow.
				- (WebResponse*)displayWithData:(NSDictionary*)data is called.
				//Subclasses can overide this to provide complete custom rendering.
				2. The defualt implementation finds a <ClassName>Template.<extention> template file using 
				- (NSData*)templateData;
				3. The defualt implementation then parses the template with
				- (NSData*)processedTemplateData:(NSData*)templateData;
				4. The defualt implementation then converts the template data into a WebResponse with
				- (WebResponse*)responseForProcessedTemplate:(NSData*)template;
